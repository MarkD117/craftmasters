## UI/UX

### Design Overview
The main goal of the site is to allow users to upload their own opinions and projects to a blog site for other people with the same interests. Inspiring conversation and interaction about all things to do with wood working. The website was designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate providing feedback to the user in the form of on screen messages. Projects are promoted on almost every page of the site encouraging user to click and see more. Everything on the site should be easy to find and self-explanatory providing a good user experience.

### Colour Scheme
Initially, I didn't want the colour scheme to be too outlandish as I didn't want it to take away from the main content of the site, which are the project articles. For this reason, I decided to use quite mellow colours throughout the site. Generally I used a 'Seasalt' white for the site background and for any text elements on a darker background. An 'Eerie Black' Colour was used for the nav bar and footer to emphasise a harsh contrast between the site body and nav/footer. 

A 'Tomato' red/orange was used for the site buttons and links as I felt an orange colour worked well with the theme of wood, being a lighter variation of brown. Most text elements on the site are in a 'Jet' grey colour as I feel it complements well against the seasalt background and is easier on the eyes compared to plain white & black. I also ued a 'Kelly Green' colour for the 'NEW' label on the site home page.

[Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) was used to generate the images of the colour palettes below.
