## UI/UX

### Design Overview
The main goal of the site is to allow users to upload their own opinions and projects to a blog site for other people with the same interests. Inspiring conversation and interaction about all things to do with wood working. The website was designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate providing feedback to the user in the form of on screen messages. Projects are promoted on almost every page of the site encouraging user to click and see more. Everything on the site should be easy to find and self-explanatory providing a good user experience.
